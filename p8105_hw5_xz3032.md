# Problem 1

Read in the data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Lets look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolced = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can i do prop test for a single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolced),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
    broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolced, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Make spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time

  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = id)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.8) + labs(title = "Observation on Each Subject Over Time") + theme_gray()

Comment: Control arm generally have lower value than experiment arm. The
observation value for both control and experiment arm fluctuate over
time but has a lightly increasing trend, especially for experiment arm.

## Problem 3

``` r
ttest = function(mu) {         #write a function with input of mu and output of t test of a normal sample with n = 30, sd =5
  sample = tibble(x = rnorm(30, mean = mu, sd = 5))
  sample %>%
    t.test(mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95) %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(estimate, p.value)
}

ttest(0)  # try the function with input of mu=0
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##   estimate p.value
    ##      <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1   0.0892   0.931

Iterate for 5000 times

``` r
sim_mu0 = rerun(5000, ttest(0)) %>%  # iterate 5000 times for the function with input  mu=0
  bind_rows()
```

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}

``` r
sim_diff_mu = 
  tibble(mu = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>%  # create a data frame with different mu and corresponding t test
  mutate(
    t_output = map(.x = mu, ~rerun(5000,ttest(.x))),    #rerun the test for different u each for 5000 times
    mean_pvalue = map(t_output, bind_rows)  
  ) %>%
  unnest(mean_pvalue) %>%      
  select(-t_output)
```

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected

``` r
power = sim_diff_mu %>%
  mutate(
    decision = case_when(p.value < 0.05 ~ "reject", p.value >= 0.05 ~ "accept")
  ) %>%   #create another variable indicate the decision
  group_by(mu) %>%  
  summarize(
    total_reject = sum(decision == "reject")   #calculate total rejection # for each mu
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    proportion = total_reject/5000
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
power_plot = power %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = proportion, color = mu)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title = "proportion of times the null was rejected")

power_plot
```

Comment:As effect size increase, the proportion of times that null was
rejected increases as well. The association between effect size and
power has a relationship similar to logarithim. Power will approach 1 as
effect size increase.

Make a plot showing the average estimate of mu on the y axis and the
true value of mu on the x axis.

``` r
estimate = sim_diff_mu %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    estimate_mu = mean(estimate)  #calculating each average mu generated from 5000 samples 
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot1 = estimate %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = estimate_mu, color = mu)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(x = "true mean", y = "estimated mean based on 5000 sample mean")
```

Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of μ̂
only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the
true value of μ on the x axis.

``` r
reject_estimate = sim_diff_mu %>%
  filter(p.value < 0.05) %>%  #only left with mu that rejected null hypothesis
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    reject_mean = mean(estimate) 
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot2 = reject_estimate %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = reject_mean, color = mu)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(x = "true mean", y = "estimated mean when H0 is rejected")

plot1 + plot2
```

Comment: Sample average mean across tests when the null is rejected is
NOT equal to the true mean, but the relationship can shift based on the
value of true mean. when the sample estimates mean is close to the null
hypothesis value(mu = 0), for example when generating sample using mu =
1, it is harder to reject the null when the standard deviation is 5. It
requires a larger sample mu which deviate further from the null in order
to reject H0. However, when mu=6 when generating sample , it is very
easy to reject H0, and in this case, the true mean the estimated mean
used to reject H0 will be almost equal.
