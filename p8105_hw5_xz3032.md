# Problem 1

Read in the data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Lets look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolced = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can i do prop test for a single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolced),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>%
    broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolced, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Make spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time

## Problem 3

``` r
ttest = function(mu) {

  sample %>%
    t.test(mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95) %>%

    select(estimate, p.value)

    ##   estimate p.value

Iterate for 5000 times

``` r
sim_mu0 = rerun(5000, ttest(0)) %>%
  bind_rows()
```

Repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}

``` r
sim_diff_mu = 
  tibble(mu = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>%
  mutate(
    t_output = map(.x = mu, ~rerun(5000,ttest(.x))),
    mean_pvalue = map(t_output, bind_rows)
  ) %>%
  unnest(mean_pvalue) %>%
  select(-t_output)
```

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected

``` r
power = sim_diff_mu %>%
  mutate(
    decision = case_when(p.value < 0.05 ~ "reject", p.value >= 0.05 ~ "accept")
  ) %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    total_reject = sum(decision == "reject")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    proportion = total_reject/5000
  )
```

Make a plot showing the average estimate of mu on the y axis and the
true value of mu on the x axis.

``` r
estimate = sim_diff_mu %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    estimate_mu = mean(estimate)

``` r
plot1 = estimate %>%

Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of μ̂
only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the
true value of μ on the x axis.

``` r
reject_estimate = sim_diff_mu %>%
  filter(p.value < 0.05) %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    reject_mean = mean(estimate)
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot2 = reject_estimate %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = reject_mean, color = mu)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
